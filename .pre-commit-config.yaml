# Pre-commit hooks for Orbinum Node
# Install: pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
# Run manually: pre-commit run --all-files
#
# WORKFLOW:
#   Quick commits (per-file):  git commit --no-verify -m "msg"
#   Full validation:           pre-commit run --all-files
#   Before push:               pre-commit run --all-files (recommended)
#
# IMPORTANT: This project uses a Makefile for consistency with CI/CD pipelines.
# All commands are executed through make targets to ensure environment consistency.
