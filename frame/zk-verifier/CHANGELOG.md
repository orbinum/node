# Changelog — pallet-zk-verifier

All notable changes to this pallet are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `verify_proof` now requires each public input to be exactly 32 bytes and rejects
  shorter inputs with `InvalidPublicInputs`, instead of silently zero-padding them
  into a different field element.
- `verify_proof` weight now scales with the number of public inputs
  (`WeightInfo::verify_proof(n)`) instead of a flat cost, since verification does
  one G1 scalar-mul per input. Prevents underpricing a many-input proof. The
  per-input term is a conservative estimate pending a re-benchmark.

### Security
- `register_verification_key` and `batch_register_verification_keys` now validate
  that the verifying key deserializes as a BN254 Groth16 key and that its arity
  (`gamma_abc_g1.len() - 1`) matches the circuit's expected public-input count.
  A wrong-arity or malformed key is rejected with `InvalidVerificationKey` at
  registration instead of being accepted silently (and failing, or verifying over
  the wrong public inputs, at proof time). Genesis is unaffected — the chain-spec
  registers keys post-genesis via the extrinsic.

## [0.7.2] — 2026-06-01

### Changed

- Updated FRAME benchmark weights measured on Hetzner CCX33 (AMD EPYC-Milan, 8 vCPU dedicated, 32 GB RAM). Steps: `50`, Repeat: `20`. `verify_proof` refreshed with real Groth16 BN254 pairing cost.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-22

### Changed

- Updated FRAME benchmark weights measured on Hetzner CCX33 (AMD EPYC-Milan, 8 vCPU dedicated, 32 GB RAM). Steps: `50`, Repeat: `20`. `verify_proof` now reflects the real Groth16 BN254 pairing cost (~12 250 µs).

### Fixed

- `lib.rs`: `verify_proof` extrinsic no longer returns `Error::VerificationFailed` under `feature = "runtime-benchmarks"`, allowing the benchmark to complete and emit a weight for the full pairing path.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- `do_verify`: removed `feature = "runtime-benchmarks"` from the `#[cfg]` bypass — the short-circuit `return true` now applies **only** in `#[cfg(test)]` builds. Previously the benchmark was measuring only FRAME overhead (~µs) instead of real Groth16 BN254 pairing cost (~8-10 ms), causing a severe weight underestimation and a potential DoS vector.

### Added

- `src/bench_fixtures/vk_transfer.bin` (488 B) — arkworks-compressed VerifyingKey for the transfer circuit, embedded via `include_bytes!`.
- `src/bench_fixtures/proof_transfer.bin` (128 B) — real Groth16 BN254 proof (A: G1, B: G2, C: G1, compressed).
- `src/bench_fixtures/public_inputs_transfer.bin` (224 B) — 7 × 32-byte LE field elements (merkle_root, nullifier×2, commitment×2, asset_id, fee).
- `scripts/generate-bench-fixtures.mjs` — Node.js script that regenerates the three fixture files using snarkjs + the transfer circuit WASM/zkey and the groth16-proofs WASM pkg. Run after any circuit change.

### Changed

- `benchmarking.rs` `verify_proof`: replaced mock 192-byte proof + 1 dummy input with real fixtures loaded via `include_bytes!`. The benchmark now exercises the full Groth16 pairing computation on BN254 so that generated weights reflect true on-chain cost.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-14

### Changed

- `ZkVerifierPort`: replaced `verify_disclosure_proof` and `batch_verify_disclosure_proofs` with `verify_value_proof`
- `CircuitId::VALUE_PROOF = 6` replaces the removed disclosure circuit (ID 4)
- README: updated Circuit IDs table and `ZkVerifierPort` documentation to reflect new interface

### Removed

- `ZkVerifierPort::verify_disclosure_proof` — use `verify_value_proof` instead
- `ZkVerifierPort::batch_verify_disclosure_proofs` — batch disclosure is no longer supported
- Circuit ID `4` (`disclosure`) — replaced by `6` (`value_proof`)
